=======================
mach\_error-Decoder-Ring is a simple+lame cocoa app that decodes `mach_error` integers

# TODO

* It would be cool to present the symbolic error name (-536854447 => kIOUSBTransactionTimeout)

* Unsigned and Hex doesn't work. (Contrast -536854447 vs. (3758112849 and 0xe0004051), which are all the same number.)
